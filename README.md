**Running Title:** A Broadly Conserved Cytidine Deaminase Protects Bacteria from Phage Infection


## Abstract

The El Tor biotype of Vibrio cholerae is responsible for perpetuating the longest cholera pandemic in recorded history (1961-current). The genomic islands VSP-1 and -2 are two understudied genetic features that distinguish El Tor from previous pandemics. To understand their utility, we calculated the co-occurrence of VSP genes across bacterial genomes. This analysis predicted the previously uncharacterized vc0175, herein renamed deoxycytidylate deaminase Vibrio (dcdV), is in a gene network with dncV, a cyclic GMP-AMP synthase involved in phage defense. DcdV consists of two domains, a P-loop kinase and a deoxycytidylate deaminase, that are required for the deamination of dCTP and dCMP, inhibiting phage predation by corrupting cellular nucleotide concentrations. Additionally, DcdV is post-translationally inhibited by a unique noncoding RNA encoded 5’ of the dcdV locus. DcdV homologs are conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes and our results identify V. cholerae DcdV as the founding member of a previously undescribed bacterial phage defense system.
